# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
Answer: I felt somewhat confident in picking up the each method and felt the terminology was relatively self explanatory. I had a more difficult time simplifying what to place inside the || pipe characters as it at first seemed like doubling the work when the 'each' method already described what I was trying to recall.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
Answer: Admittedly I started out with an unproductive struggle with this being one of my final assignments towards the end of a very long day, and got caught up with things not working out. I went for a walk, came back to it and was able to more clearly articulate how to correctly input my each commands.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I am going to work on practicing the each method as it relates to different types of problem solving. I did not realize this method would permit me to place an "if" statement so I got stuck on the practice questions for quite a while.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
As of right now I do not have any questions, but my small group has been great in helping out with previous places I've gotten stuck!
